# Rust Mutable vs. Immutable References

This repository demonstrates a common error in Rust programming involving mutable and immutable references. The `bug.rs` file contains code that attempts to modify a value through an immutable reference, which results in a compile-time error. The `bugSolution.rs` file provides a corrected version of the code.

## Understanding the Issue

Rust's borrow checker ensures memory safety by carefully managing references. A mutable reference (`&mut`) allows modification of the referenced value, while an immutable reference (`&`) only allows reading.  Attempting to simultaneously hold a mutable and an immutable reference to the same value is forbidden to prevent data races and unexpected behavior. 

## How to Solve the Issue

The solution involves restructuring the code to ensure that only mutable references are used when modification is needed, or to create separate immutable references to avoid conflicts.
